% DESCRIPTION:
%  Calculates the absorption spectrum using the absorbance for a given 
%  wavenumber region of the incident light (laser), molecule, temperature, 
%  and instrument characteristics. An overlap function is calculated, based 
%  on two Voigt functions of the laser and the transition, see function 
%  overlap, with a given laser linewidth parameter (Gaussian and Lorentzian
%  linewidth contributions).
%
% INPUTS:
%   wnum     - The wavenumber range to be simulated, in cm-1, e.g. wnum = 
%              44407:0.1:44417;.
%   linelist - A cell containing the list of lines, each line data is stored 
%              in a line struct, see selectLines and linesStruct.
%   MM       - Molar mass g/mol
%   T        - Temperature in Kelvin
%   dnuGL    - The Gaussian FWHM of the laser profile.
%   dnuLL    - The Lorentzian FWHM of the laser profile.
%
% OPTIONAL INPUTS:
%   params - This is a set of optional parameters used as a name-value cell 
%            or struct
%     -	Z         - The partition function acquired from selectLines. This may
%                   be omitted if not available, however it is not recommended.
%     -	dnuL      - The Lorentzian linewidth of the transition, resulting from 
%                   collisional broadening. This parameter is set by using collisions
%                   and collisionalBroadening. If the latter is not available 
%                   and no value for dnuL is set, then a minimal default value
%                   is assumed, 0.0001 cm-1, and thereby the overall Lorentzian
%                   feature of the overlap function is controlled mainly through
%                   the laser parameter dnuLL.
%     -	dnuSh     - The collisional shifting parameter, to be set using collisions
%                   and collisionalBroadening. In case no collision data available, 
%                   this value is zero and maybe used as a free parameter to 
%                   adjust the shift.
%     -	resFactor - A divider factor to the step value of wnum. This is used 
%                   for defining the resolution for the overlap function generation. 
%                   See overlap in section â€Ž4.6.1. If not given, the default value is 5. 
%     -	normalize - A Boolean flag to normalize the spectra. The default value 
%                   is true. 
%     -	limit     - This is a limiting factor used as multiplier to the sum of 
%                   the linewidth (dnuG, dnuL, dnuGL, dnuLL). The result multiplication
%                   is considered as a range limit around a given center frequency.
%                   The higher the limit is, the further lines from the center 
%                   frequency would be considered for interpolation. This is set
%                   to 12 by default, if the user did not pass the parameter. 
%     -	N         - The number density of the absorbing molecules, m^-3.
%     -	L         - The length of the absorption path, m.
%
% OUTPUT:
%   spec  - The calculated absorption spectrum with the same length as wnum.
