# LIFSim 4.0

 
An open-source MATLAB-based tool, simulates absorption, excitation, and emission spectra of diatomic molecules, incorporating effects such as line broadening and quenching based on spectroscopic data. It enables multi-line LIF thermometry for images or single spectra. These tools also enable temperature sensitivity analysis and fitting of excitation spectra. For more about the features, check out: https://www.lifsim.com/functionality/ 

Version 4.0 achieves a transparent implementation of the models through MATLAB scripts, which are open-source. This implementation targets two audience groups, the first group are researchers with limited programming skills, using livescripts, enabling easy access to individually simulated spectra. The second group are researchers with programming skills for which we provide the documentation of the functions and scripts to enable embedding in complex data analysis workflows.
